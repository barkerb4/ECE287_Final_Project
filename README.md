# 2-D Platformer Video Game 
ECE 287 Final Project for Jamieson's Section C  
**Authors: Drew Zabkar ('27) & Ben Barker ('24)**  
## Project Description  
Our project implements a VGA output that displays a character that changes position through a Finite State Machine that implements a VGA Driver. The character must jump on platforms to reach the top and win the game.  
## Background Information
For our project, we wanted to create a 2D platformer video game where we could control a character's horizontal and vertical movement. We were inspired by the original Donkey Kong 2D platformer. We were limited to a DE1-SoC development board
