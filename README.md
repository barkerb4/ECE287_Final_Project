# 2-D Platformer Video Game 
ECE 287 Final Project for Jamieson's Section C  
**Authors: Drew Zabkar ('27) & Ben Barker ('24)**  
## Project Description  
Our project attempts to implement VGA output to display a 2-D platformer game. The game uses a finite state machine to move a character to navigate a maze. The game is completed when the character reaches the end of the maze. Our project is not currently working as intended in this state.
